# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *This program will write out your first name with turtle.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *I tried to get it to use the full 256 range of colors but it wasn't accepting the tuple for some reason so I just went back to the regular color strings.*

## REFERENCES *I used this program for the letter drawings and then modified it to integrate more with my own program: https://github.com/adityadroid/Alphabeter/blob/master/alphabeter.py*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *I hope you enjoy it!*
